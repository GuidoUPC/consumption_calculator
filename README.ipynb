    "# Energy Consumption Estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python program helps you estimate the energy consumption of an embedded system composed of **sensors**, a **microcontroller**, and a **radio interface** over a given measurement duration. The tool guides you through inputting component specifications and then computes and visualizes different cosumption aspects of the system.\n",

    "\n",
    "## üõ†Ô∏è Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interactive CLI input to define system components:\n",
    "  - Sensors (with configurable sampling rates and activity profiles)\n",
    "  - Microcontrollers (including different power states)\n",
    "  - Radio Interfaces (data rates, active/inactive states)\n",
    "- Supports loading from a predefined list of available components\n",
    "- Calculates total energy consumption over a user-defined time span\n",
    "- Displays energy usage with:\n",
    "  - System settings table\n",
    "  - Results table\n",
    "  - Pie charts with consumption from different components\n",
    "  - Pie charts with active/inactive consumption for all the components\n",
    "  - Timeserie plot with consumption of the system over the measurement time. Splitting the cunsumption by components\n",

    "## üìä Output Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "The program will generate three figures with different visualizations.\n",
    "1. First figure contains a table for each selected component with its specifications.\n",
    "![Figure 1](./images/figure-1.png)\n",
    "2. It contains three pie charts, one for each system componment (sensoring, microcontroller and radio interface). The chart compares the active/inactive consumption of the components. All sensors are summarized in just one chart.\n",
    "![Figure 2](./images/figure-2.png)\n",
    "3. Last figure displays the consumption of the whole system split by components. In the upper side there are two pie charts with the current and power consumption respectively. In the middle there is a time series plot with all components consumption stacked over the time. And in the lower side there is a table displaying the following values for each component:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Current consumption\n",
    "    - Maximum current\n",
    "    - Average current\n",
